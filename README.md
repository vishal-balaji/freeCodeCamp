My journey through the freeCodeCamp course.

## Responsive Web Design Certification
**2020-04-17:** Completed the basic HTML and HTML5 exercises. Pretty straightforward. Since I already have experience with HTML there wasn't anything new that I learnt.

**2020-04-17 #02:** Completed the basic CSS exercise. I never knew that basic CSS even had varaibles. Kinda just assumed that it never had it and thats why other languages like Sass exists.
